## **Disability Access Now**

**Disability Access Now** is a full-stack web application designed to help people with disabilities apply for Social Security Disability Insurance. Millions of individuals each year with disabilities do not get the services they deserve because they have difficulty applying for benefits on inaccessible websites. Our platform is an all-in-one, accessible, efficient, and personalized website that even allows admins to assist users when all else fails.

### **My Contributions:**

- **PDF Storage and Search:** Used the **File Access System API** to convert PDF data into Base64 binary, storing it directly in **SQL databases** for secure handling and retrieval.
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensured all pages were fully functional with keyboards (no traps), added **ARIA labels**, and guaranteed compatibility with screen readers.
- **Primary Accessibility Contact:** Collaborated with Rory Hager, an accessibility consultant, who audited our website to **WCAG 2.1 AA standards** and provided feedback to enhance compliance.
- **Frontend Integration:** Collaborated with the team to implement features ensuring seamless navigation and usability.
