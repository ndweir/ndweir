# PorchFest ðŸŽ¶  

**PorchFest** is a web application designed to connect bands and venues for the Uptown Porchfest music festival in Minnesota. With PorchFest, bands can find venues using Google Maps, and venues can discover performers by previewing their music through an integrated Spotify player.  

## Why PorchFest?  
PorchFest showcases my ability to:  
- Build intuitive **frontend interfaces** with React, Material UI, and APIs.  
- Develop scalable **backend systems** with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.  
- Create custom, user-focused **designs** using Figma.  

My background as a teacher gives me strong communication skills, allowing me to collaborate effectively with technical experts while simplifying complex ideas for non-technical users.  

## Features  
- **Bands**: Discover and explore venues through Google Maps.  
- **Venues**: Preview artistsâ€™ music and plan performances seamlessly.
